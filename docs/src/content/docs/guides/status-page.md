title: The status page
description: What visitors see on Hora's status page, what you see once signed in, and the other ways to read it.
---

Hora serves its status page itself, at `/`, rendered on the server with no
JavaScript framework. It is the same page for your visitors and for you;
what changes is how much it shows.

<div class="hora-shot">
	<img class="light-only" src="/hora/screenshot-light.webp" width="1400" height="980" alt="The Hora status page in light: the hour and one sentence, the counts, the services by group with their daily bars." />
	<img class="dark-only" src="/hora/screenshot-dark.webp" width="1400" height="980" alt="The Hora status page in dark: the hour and one sentence, the counts, the services by group with their daily bars." />
</div>

## What visitors see

A visitor without a token sees the **public** monitors (`public = true`, the
default) and nothing else, from the top:

- **The hour and one sentence** that answers "is it working?":
  *Everything is running.*, *Card payments is down.*, *Planned
  maintenance, until 23:30.* The owl beside it takes the same state. Under
  it, a chip per count (*12 up*, *1 down*), *No incident in 15 days* while
  nothing is down, and the next planned window, up to a week ahead.
- **Announcements**: banners you pinned with `hora announce`,
  `POST /api/announce` or `[[incidents]]` in the config, newest first. See
  [Announcements](../alerting/#announcements).
- **Maintenance**: a window in progress, with how far along it is, and the
  monitors it covers.
- **Needs attention**: whatever is not plainly up, worst first, each with
  one line of why: *Since 14:02 UTC (38 min). Last answer: HTTP 503.*,
  *Answers take 1.8 s (usually 120 ms).*
- **Services, by group** (`group = "..."`): each with its state as a shape
  and a word, its uptime over the bar's days, and a daily bar over
  `[page] history_days` (90 by default). Each row and bar opens the
  monitor's own page.
- **Recent incidents**: the last three, with the note you added to each
  (`hora annotate`), and a link to the whole history.
- **Who keeps watch**: with peers, how many places check the services.

Every state has a shape, a word and a colour, so none relies on colour
alone: up is a disc, *Slow* a half disc, *Down* a diamond, *Maintenance* a
clock, *No data* a dashed ring. In the daily bar, a day's height is part of
its state too: up all day is full height, slow at times is shorter, an
outage drops below the line, a day a [maintenance window](../alerting/#maintenance-windows)
touched is half height (unless it still was an outage), and a day without
data is a stub.

**Root cause** reads in the same line of why: *Probably caused by
Database.* on a monitor down because of an upstream, *Web app depends on
it.* on the upstream itself.

**From several places**: with [peers](../peers/), a down that only this
node sees, while every peer reaches the target, is a network problem near
this node, not an outage. The page shows the service as *Up* with a calm
*Not an outage* notice, and the monitor's channels are not paged (only
`alerts.notify_unconfirmed`, if set; see
[local-only downs](../peers/#local-only-downs)). A down the peers confirm
says where it was seen from.

Failure reasons are reduced to a safe category for visitors (*HTTP 500*,
*content check failed*): the full reason can contain response bodies, DNS
answers or the keyword you assert on. A monitor opts into publishing the
full detail with `public_error_detail = true`.

**At scale**, past 30 monitors, the page stays light: groups where all is
well fold into one row with the group's bar, open on a click, and a group
lists at most 24 services, problems first; *Show all* opens the group's own
page. On 700 monitors the page weighs about 70 kB.

### Each monitor's page

`/monitor/{id}` has the rest: the uptime over the bar's days with its
outages (*One outage, 41 min, on 18 Sep*), the response time over 24 hours,
one link per day of the bar with what happened that day, the hour-by-hour
heatmap of the last four weeks, the places that check it, and its
incidents.

### Theme and wall screens

The page follows the visitor's light or dark setting. The button at the
top cycles *Auto*, *Light* and *Dark*; `?theme=light` or `?theme=dark` in
the link forces one (for an embed), and the choice follows the visitor
from page to page.

The page does not reload by itself. For a wall screen or a kiosk, add
`?refresh=60` to the link: the page then reloads every 60 seconds (any
value from 10 to 3600; anything else is ignored) and says so at the top.

It reads well on a phone, and goes on its home screen as an app (*Add to
Home Screen*): the owl as its icon, your page title as its name, opening
on the live status page.

## What you see

With the operator's read token (`server.auth_token`), the same page also
shows:

- **Private monitors** (`public = false`). Without the token, a private
  monitor is absent everywhere: page, API, badges, history and feed. Its
  endpoints answer 404, exactly like an id that does not exist.
- **Full failure detail** on every monitor, and the captured response of
  the last failure in the history.
- **Why nobody was woken**: for a down seen from this node only, who saw
  what, place by place, and where such a down goes with your config (the
  quiet channels, or nowhere).
- **The watched peers**, with when each was last heard from, and the
  **Watchers** page (`/watchers`): this node's view of its peers, the last
  30 days of confirmations, each shared service from each place.
- **Event markers** (`hora event "deploy api v2.3"`) as dashed lines on
  each monitor's response-time chart.
- **Channel health** in `/api/summary` and `hora top`.

The header says *Operator* while you are signed in. For a browser, the
simplest way to present the token is a link with `?token=...` (read-only
views accept it); the links on the page carry it on. Keep that link
private; it ends up in browser history. It only reads: silences,
announcements, events and alerts need the separate `server.admin_token`. Scripts should send
`Authorization: Bearer` instead (see
[Authentication](../../reference/api/#authentication)).

A [group token](../multi-tenant/#group-tokens) sits in between: it reveals
everything about one group on `/status/{group}`, and nothing about the
others.

## Other pages

| Page | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `/monitor/{id}` | One monitor: its figures, its days, where it is checked from, its incidents. |
| `/history` | Confirmed incidents, newest first, with their notes. See [Incidents & history](../incidents/). |
| `/history.atom` | The same incidents as an Atom feed, to follow in a feed reader. |
| `/incident/{id}` | One incident as a post-mortem, with the markdown ready to copy. |
| `/timeline` | One chronology of the last 7 days: downs and recoveries, events, pushed alerts, announcements and silences. |
| `/status/{group}` | One group's page. See [Per-group pages](../multi-tenant/). |
| `/report/{YYYY-MM}` | The printable monthly SLA report, with a strip of each service's days. |
| `/watchers` | The operator's view of the peers (operator only). |

Visitors see sanitized versions of each: public monitors only, safe failure
categories, no event markers or silences.

## In a terminal

`curl` (or `wget`, or any client that asks for `text/plain`) gets an aligned
plain-text page instead of HTML, on `/` and on `/status/{group}`:

```
$ curl -s https://status.example.com/

Card payments is down. 6 of 8 services are up. One is down and one is slow; the rest is fine.
Saturday 3 October, 14:40 UTC

  ● Mobile sync  Up             100.0%      71ms

Payments and email
------------------
  ◆ Card payments   Down            97.3%         -
  ● Bank transfers  Up             100.0%     210ms
  ◐ Invoice emails  Slow           100.0%    1820ms
  ● Webhooks        Up             100.0%      95ms
```

Each line has the state's shape and its word (`●` up, `◐` slow, `◆` down,
`◷` maintenance, `◌` no data), the 24-hour uptime and the latest answer
time. A down seen from one place only reads *Up*, with a line under it
saying so.

For a live view that also acts (announce, silence), use
[`hora top`](../../reference/cli/#hora-top).

## Embedding and machines

- **Badges**: `/api/badge/{id}/status` and `/api/badge/{id}/uptime` are SVG
  badges for a README. See [Badges](../../reference/api/#badges).
- **JSON**: `/api/summary` has everything the page shows.
- **Prometheus**: `/metrics`.

## Behind a reverse proxy

Hora serves plain HTTP and assumes nothing about its domain: put it behind
Caddy, nginx or Cloudflare. Two settings matter there:

- **`server.client_ip_header`**: every page is rate-limited per client IP.
  Without this setting, every visitor shares the proxy's address and its
  bucket. Set it to the header your proxy writes (`x-real-ip`, or
  `cf-connecting-ip` behind Cloudflare). See
  [Rate limiting](../../reference/api/#rate-limiting--security-headers).
- **HSTS** belongs to the proxy that terminates TLS.

## Settings

```toml
[page]
title = "My services"   # shown at the top and in the browser tab
history_days = 90       # days in the uptime bar
logo = "logo.svg"       # beside the title, instead of its initial
logo_dark = "logo-dark.svg"   # optional: the dark theme's
```

The header shows the title beside a tile with its initial; `logo` puts
your own mark there instead, on every page and on the monthly report. It is
an SVG, PNG, WebP or JPEG file of 256 KiB at most, relative to the config
file (in Docker, `/etc/hora/logo.svg` next to the config). Hora reads it
with the config, so after replacing the image alone, save the config to
reload it.

If your mark needs other colours on a dark page, give that version as
`logo_dark`: the page shows the one of the theme in force, the visitor's
system or the one they chose with the theme button (`?theme=`), and prints
the light one. Use two files rather than an SVG with its own
`@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` rules: an image follows the system,
never the theme button.

Per monitor: `group`, `public`, `public_error_detail`, `depends_on` (for
the cause and impact lines), `slo_uptime` (for the budget), and
`degraded_over_ms`.
