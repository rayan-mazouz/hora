//! Root-cause alert grouping: one notification per incident, not one per
//! affected monitor.
//!
//! Every down/recovered alert flows through here. Alerts from monitors with
//! no configured upstreams (`depends_on`) are roots: they go out immediately,
//! and their `impacted` list already names the blast radius. Monitors *with*
//! upstreams wait out a short grouping window: if any transitive upstream
//! alerted - before, or while they wait - the alert folds into that single
//! notification (suppressed), and so does its eventual recovery. Grouping is
//! keyed on the *configured* upstreams, not on the cause derived at
//! confirmation time: in a cascade the dependent often confirms a tick before
//! its upstream has enough recorded failures to be derivably down, and the
//! grouping must not lose that race. A monitor that recovers while still
//! queued was a flap inside the window: nothing is sent at all. Incident
//! *records* are written by the scheduler before alerts reach this point, so
//! the history stays complete whatever is folded here.
//!
//! A *local-only* down (every peer that answered sees the target up) is not an
//! outage: it skips the grouping, covers nothing, and goes to the
//! `alerts.notify_unconfirmed` channels instead of the monitor's own (or
//! nowhere without them). If the peers later confirm it, the real down follows
//! as usual. A recovery goes to whoever received a down: the usual channels,
//! the quiet ones, or both.
