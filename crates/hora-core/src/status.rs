//! Typed status values: the verdict of one check, and what a monitor is now.
//!
//! [`CheckStatus`] is what a probe, a push or a recorded miss produces and what
//! `checks.status` stores (0 down, 1 up, 2 degraded). [`MonitorState`] is the
//! current state derived from the latest checks, which adds `unknown` (no data)
//! and only calls a monitor down once the failure threshold confirms it.
